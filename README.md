# 📦 Energy Aware: Decentralised Aggregation Mechanisms in Federated Learning
This repository presents the implementation and experimental results of energy-efficient, decentralised aggregation strategies in Federated Learning (FL) systems. The proposed framework reduces communication overhead and energy consumption by using a graph-based topology and decentralised update mechanisms, replacing traditional centralised server-based aggregation.

🔍 Key Features
⚡ Energy-Aware Design: Minimises device power usage by adaptive client participation based on energy and performance trade-offs.

🧠 Decentralised Aggregation: Eliminates the need for a central server using peer-to-peer model exchanges.

🕸️ Graph Topology: Clients are connected through dynamic directed graphs, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.

🧪 Simulation & Results: Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets demonstrating efficiency in accuracy vs. energy/performance metrics.
